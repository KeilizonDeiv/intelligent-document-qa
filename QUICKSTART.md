## First Time Usage

### Try It Out:

1. **Upload a document**
   - Click the upload area
   - Select a PDF, DOCX, or TXT file
   - Wait for processing (10-30 seconds)

2. **Ask your first question**
   - Type in the chat: "What is this document about?"

🤖 **Claude Integration:** Uses latest AI for natural answers  
📚 **Source Citations:** Every answer shows where info came from  
💬 **Memory:** Remembers conversation context  

---

## Sample Use Cases

### 📄 Research Papers
Upload: "research_paper.pdf"  
Ask: "What methodology did they use?"  
Ask: "Compare their results with previous studies"

### 📋 Company Docs
Upload: "employee_handbook.pdf"  
Ask: "What's the vacation policy?"  
Ask: "How do I request time off?"

### 📚 Study Materials
Upload: "textbook_chapter.pdf"  
Ask: "Explain the main concepts"  
Ask: "Give me practice questions"

### 💼 Business Reports
Upload: "quarterly_report.pdf"  
Ask: "What were the key findings?"  
Ask: "What are the recommendations?"

## Understanding the Interface

### Left Panel: Document Library
- **Upload Area:** Drag & drop or click to upload
- **Stats:** Number of documents and chunks
- **Document List:** See all uploaded files
- **Settings:** Configure search behavior

### Center: Chat Interface
- **Welcome Screen:** Shows features and tips
- **Chat History:** Your Q&A conversation
- **Input Box:** Type your questions
- **Sample Questions:** Quick start suggestions

### Right Panel: Context & Sources
- **Query Context:** How many chunks retrieved
- **Model Used:** Which AI model generated answer
- **Sources:** Documents cited with relevance scores
- **Previews:** See the actual text used

---

## Tips for Best Results

### 🎯 Ask Specific Questions
❌ "Tell me about this"  
✅ "What are the three main recommendations in section 2?"

### 📊 Use Follow-Ups
First: "What is machine learning?"  
Then: "Give me examples of it" (uses context!)

### 🔍 Adjust Settings
- **More results** (7-10) for comprehensive answers
- **Fewer results** (3-5) for focused answers
- **Hybrid search ON** for best accuracy

### 📝 Upload Quality Documents
- Text-based PDFs work best (not scanned images)
- Well-formatted documents process better
- Multiple documents enable cross-referencing

---

## Common Issues & Solutions

### "No documents uploaded yet"
**Solution:** Upload at least one document before asking questions

### "Could not extract text"
**Problem:** Scanned PDF or image-based document  
**Solution:** Use text-based PDFs or convert with OCR first

### Slow first upload
**Normal:** Embedding model downloads on first run (~500MB)  
**After first time:** Uploads are much faster (5-10 seconds)

### "Error generating response"
**Check:** API key in .env file  
**Check:** Internet connection  
**Check:** API credits remaining

## For Your Resume

### One-Liner Description
"Built RAG system with vector embeddings and Claude AI for intelligent document Q&A"

### What to Highlight

**In Projects Section:**
```
AI Document Intelligence Assistant
• Implemented RAG architecture with semantic search and vector embeddings
• Integrated Claude API for natural language generation
• Built multi-format document processor supporting PDF, DOCX, TXT
• Technologies: Python, ChromaDB, Sentence Transformers, Flask
• GitHub: [your-repo-link]
```

**In Skills Section:**
- Vector databases (ChromaDB)
- LLM integration (Claude API)
- RAG systems
- Sentence Transformers
- Semantic search

---

## Interview Talking Points

### Technical Explanation
"I built a Retrieval Augmented Generation system that converts documents into vector embeddings using Sentence Transformers. When a user asks a question, the system performs semantic search in ChromaDB to find relevant chunks, then sends those to Claude API as context to generate an accurate, grounded answer."

### Why RAG?
"RAG solves the hallucination problem by grounding LLM responses in actual document content. It's more efficient than fine-tuning and allows real-time updates as documents change."

### Challenges Solved
- Optimal chunk size/overlap for context preservation
- Hybrid search for both semantic and keyword matching
- Managing conversation context within token limits
- Real-time embedding generation without blocking UI
